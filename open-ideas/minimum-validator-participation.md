# Minimum validator participation

## Introduction:
This task is more of an analysis and requires a decently deep understanding of the ethereum beaconchain specification.

The beaconchain is meant to be resilient to a vast number of failure modes. One of them is a large portion of the validator set being unable to perform their duties. However, if too low a percentage of validators are online, then the network starts to struggle to include attestations and duties - leading to a death spiral.

This task would be to analyze at what point the failure modes start at as well as potentially think of optimizations that could help improve the resilience.
