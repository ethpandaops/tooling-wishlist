# Tooling-Wishlist

Note: This isn't a public RFP document. This is purely a wishlist of tools that the team would find interesting.

This repo is meant to hold ideas for tooling that we would love to see someday. Most tools are aimed at helping debug 
and run testnets. 

## Wishlist:
- Lightweight beaconchain explorer (being worked on)
- Combined forkmonitor
- Updated Testnet homepage
- Faucet with configurable sybil mechanisms (done)
- Wrapper for hive to launch local testnets
- Chaos testing Ethereum (being worked on)
